\chapter{Physical Layer}\label{sec:osi_physical}
\section{tl;dr}
The first layer of the OSI model is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a medium, with little to no concern for the content involved. It defines the hardware elements used in the communication process, such as cables, switches, and network interface cards (NICs).

\begin{noteblock}
    It might come across as a surprise, but routers are \textbf{not} part of the Physical Layer. The intuition as to why that is is that routers \textit{route}, hence they need to understand the content of the packets they are forwarding. This is a function of the Network Layer (Layer 3) in the OSI model.
\end{noteblock}

The Physical Layer is responsible for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Converting bits to electrical, optical, or radio signals
    \item Defining voltage levels, timing, and physical data rates
    \item Specifying physical connectors and cable types
    \item Managing the physical topology of the network (which we'll be using Cisco Packet Tracer to visualize)
    \item Synchronizing transmission between devices
\end{itemize}
